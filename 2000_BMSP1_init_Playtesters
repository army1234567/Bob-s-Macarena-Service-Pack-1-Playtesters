All within a century.</p>\n\n<p>The world has never been as wealthy as it is today, and world hunger has never been as low as well. On that note, the Millennium's first ever presidential election is about to kick off. It sees 77-year-old President Bob Dole face off with the Speaker of the House, Dick Gephardt.</p>\n\n<p>Issues around the campaign revolve around foreign affairs, especially in regards to the Balkans, with the last decade's implosion of Yugoslavia, which has ended in disaster for those living there, along with the recent rise in global terrorism, especially in regards to Islamist groups based in the Middle East. In regards to social issues, abortion, healthcare in general, and the recent rise of the gay pride movement are hotly debated on the internet forums and newspapers. One of the most pressing issues is the debate over the roughly $275 billion budget surplus, in particular about how to use the money.</p>\n\n<p>Despite President Dole's personal popularity, the race is expected to be close on election day. Both candidates must tread carefully, as even one mistake can cost them the election.</p></div>",

All the polls had him trailing Clinton heavily, even though just a year earlier he was polled to defeat Clinton for re-election. When election night came, he watched the results already resigned to the fact that Clinton would be elected to a second term.</p>\n\n<p>But the opposite happened. In the most surprising upset since 1948, he unexpectedly beat Clinton. While he won the Electoral College, Clinton won the day in the popular vote. So, President-elect Dole will find himself in a peculiar situation when he takes the oath on January 20th. When that happens, he's going to need to find a way to win over the hearts of the vast majority of the American people, and quickly before the 1998 midterms. If the midterms prove disastrous, Dole can kiss his chances for re-election goodbye against whichever schmuck the Democrats nominate in 2000.</p></div>",

It's clear with the results of the primary; the base is yearning for history to be made. They're tired of the same old same old. The same old fully white, male ticket.</p><p>And it so happens that Wellstone promised to select a female running mate. While Wellstone didn't win the nomination, it might be a good idea to take that idea and employ it on your own to keep his people happy.</p><p>The team has narrowed down the historic female option to one woman: Dianne Feinstein.</p><p>She's a trailblazer. She's Jewish, the first woman to represent California in the Senate, as well as the first to be Mayor of San Francisco, during which she was ranked as one of America's most effective mayors.</p><p>So, she's got the record, but what about some things she's passionate about? Well, she's an ardent believer in gun control, authoring the Assault Weapons Ban, which may or may not help you, depending on how you run your campaign. She's also firmly in the pro-choice camp of the abortion argument, as well as a strong advocate for national defense, which could help your defectiveness in that regard slightly.</p><p>If you really want to catch headlines, Feinstein's your option; however, you must consider this: she's up for re-election this year. If you select her, she likely can't run for another term. So, you've really got to be sure about your chances at victory if you plan on selecting her, because if you lose, you've sacrificed an experienced Senator for nothing.</p></div>",

However, there are a few things that could really go wrong with him being selected.</p><p>First off, he's a former segregationist.

                <p><strong>Robert Joseph Dole</strong> is the 43rd President of the United States, inaugurated on January 20th, 1997. He is a Republican from Kansas and is the oldest man to hold that office. He previously served as the Senate Majority Leader. He was Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976 and made two previous aborted runs for the presidency in 1980 and 1988, respectively. He is considered a moderate conservative, and his record in the Senate reflects that. He also has a reputation for being overly rude to his political opponents. In recent times, he's been trying to moderate himself in this regard.</p>

                <img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144129845.png" alt="Liz Dole" />
                <p><strong>Mary Elizabeth Alexander Dole</strong> is the First Lady of the United States. However, unlike other First Ladies, she's had a political career completely seperate from her husband's. She has served as the Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, the Director of the Office of Public Liaison, Secretary of Transportation, and most recently the Secretary of Labor. Due to this, there was widespread speculation that she might actually be given an official cabinet spot in the Dole Administration, however this did not occur, however, she is considered the President's closest confidant and most trusted adcisor. She has focused on education, advocating for standardlized testing.</p>

                <img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144206099.png" alt="Vice President Kemp" />
                <p><strong>Jack French Kemp</strong> is the 46th Vice President of the United States and is a proud New Yorker. He was previously a member of the Bush Administration and had a successful tenure in the House. He was a quarterback for the Buffalo Bills after briefly serving in the US Army. He made his own run for the presidency in 1988 and has long been considered a rival to Dole; however, they seemingly put their rivalry aside in order to end the Clinton administration early. Despite Dole's initial unpopularity, Kemp is still very much popular with the public.</p>

                <img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144233460.png" alt="Joanne Kemp" />
                <p><strong>Joanne Main Kemp</strong> is the Second Lady of the United States, married to her college sweetheart, Jack Kemp. She has been significant to Jack's political life, as a miscarriage the couple suffered affirmed his own opposition to abortion. Their married life revolves around their two daughters and two sons. Because of this, her main focus as Second Lady has been empowering women at home and at work, as well as the protection and care of young children.</p>

                <img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144343965.png" alt="Secretary Powell" />
                <p><strong>Colin Luther Powell</strong> is the 64th United States Secretary of State. He is a trailblazer, a moniker seldom applied to a Republican in recent years, as he's the first African American to hold the post, therefore making him the highest-ranking Black man in US political history. Before that, he served as the 12th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the 15th US National Security Advisor, being the first Black man in both posts as well. He is a Vietnam War veteran, and along with General Schwartzkopf, is considered one of the masterminds of the liberation of Kuwait. Declining offers to be made into a 5-star general, a draft campaign for a bid for the presidency as a Republican was established for 1996; however, he graciously refused. His refusal was at the time what the media considered to be the GOP losing any chance of defeating Bill Clinton, but of course time proved them wrong. His record makes him a solid cabinet member, and his unanimous confirmation highlights that.</p>
                
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144405540.png" alt="Secretary Roth" />
                <p><strong>William Victor Roth Jr.</strong> is the 71st United States Secretary of the Treasury, and by all means he's a no-brainer pick to head the Treasury Department. Serving Delaware in the Senate for 26 years, he is the man responsible for the creation of the Roth IRA, which is named after him. Despite his excellent credentials for the office, his nomination was a bit controversial among Gingrichites, as he has on occasion broken with core party policies, such as voting in favor of the Brady Bill while he was in the Senate. However, his wit and credentials won over the Senate, and he was confirmed, though three Republicans voted against him.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144434912.png" alt="Secretary Spence" />
                <p><strong>Floyd Davidson Spence</strong> is a South Carolinian former Democrat turned Republican who finds himself as the 20th United States Secretary of Defense. A former congressman, he spent the final full term he was elected to in the Capitol as chair of the House National Security Committee, and before then, he was the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, which he renamed to the National Security Committee upon taking up the chairmanship, therefore well equipping himself for his confirmation upon his nomination. Aside from that, he served in the Navy Reserve, reaching the rank of Captain. He is considered a capable defense secretary, despite his age.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144500299.png" alt="AG Danforth" />
                <p><strong>The Reverend John Claggett Danforth</strong> is the man responsible for turning Missouri from a Democratic dominated state, to a bellweather state rapidly approaching Republican dominance. A highly popular US Senator, he was on George Bush's VP shortlist in 1988, and in fact Bush got quite close to settling on him. A Dole loyalist for decades, being a prominent supporter of both his 1988 and 1996 campaigns, Dole nominated him to be the 79th United States Attorney General, and he was unanimously confirmed, being wildly popular with his former colleagues, also being renown for his level headedness and relatively unbiased nature when it comes to the law.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144533969.png" alt="Secretary Campbell" />
                <p><strong>Ben Nighthorse Campbell</strong> was initially tapped to be the 48th United States Secretary of the Interior by President Dole for two very specific reasons, despite being a freshman senator from Colorado. First off, he's a proud Native American. He specifically belongs to the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. Having a Native American head the interior department, in Dole's opinion, could symbolize his administration's good intentions towards the Native tribes of the United States. Secondly, Campbell was first elected as a Democrat; however, he switched parties just three years after being elected to the Senate. So, having a relatively new Republican in the cabinet could symbolize unity between the two parties within his cabinet. He was confirmed unanimously.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144553504.png" alt="Secretary Geringer" />
                <p><strong>James Edward Geringer</strong> was the 30th Governor of Wyoming for a couple of years before he was tapped by President Dole to be the 27th United States Secretary of Agriculture. His father was a Volga German immigrant, and his mother was from Sweden. He served from 1967 to 1991 in the Air Force, the first decade being active duty, the rest in the reserves. He has a mechanical engineering background and ran his own farm, like many in his state. He ran the state as a conservative; however, he broke with the party by supporting efforts to combat climate change and supporting the Equal Rights Amendment. As a result, a few Republican senators opposed his nomination, however not enough to not confirm him.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144612164.png" alt="Secretary Engler" />
                <p><strong>John Mathias Engler</strong> was on Dole's Vice Presidential shortlist back in 1996, so it was hardly a surprise to the public when he was announced to be the President's nominee to be the 32nd United States Secretary of Commerce. At the time of his nomination, he was serving as the 46th Governor of Michigan. He also concurrently served as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association from 1996 to his resignation upon assuming his seat in the Dole Administration. Seen as a relatively uncontroversial pick from a swing state, he had no trouble being confirmed by the Senate.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144631690.png" alt="Secretary Ros-Lehtinen" />
                <p><strong>Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,</strong> the 23rd United States Secretary of Labor was born in Cuba mere years before the dawn of the Castro regime. She succeeded the late former Senator and Chair of the House Rules Committee Claude Pepper in a special election for his seat in 1989, a pick-up for the Republican Party, making her the first Cuban-American elected to Congress and the first woman from Florida to serve as well. She was particularly passionate about dealing with Cuba and defending Israel in Congress. Dole nominated her to head the Labor Department due to her ability to retain an open mind even if she was opinionated towards the issue in question. This ability is what made her nomination sail through the Senate.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144649051.png" alt="Secretary Frist" />
                <p><strong>Thomas Fearn Frist Jr.,</strong> the 19th United States Secretary of Health and Human Services is the brother of freshman US Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. A surgeon by trade, like his brother and father, he served as a flight surgeon in the Air Force before co-founding the Hospital Corporation of America with his father and a colleague of his, earning a considerable amount of wealth from this venture. Dole nominated him after Senator Frist suggested him for the position during a meeting during the transitional period in December 1996. Due to his relations with his brother and his experience in the medical field, his nomination was approved with relatively little opposition.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144714008.png" alt="Secretary Franks" />
                <p><strong>Gary Alvin Franks,</strong> the 11th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development first came to public attention for being the first African American to be elected to Congress from Connecticut in 1990, serving until 1997, after losing re-election. However, he wasn't out of office for long, as Dole was looking for a noncontroversial, diverse pick for the role of HUD Secretary, and it just so happened that Franks was that option. His confirmation went fairly well, given his conservatism swayed the Republicans to his side, while his New England roots put Democrats at ease.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144740164.png" alt="Secretary Kean" />
                <p><strong>Thomas Howard Kean</strong> was nominated by President Dole and confirmed as the 13th United States Secretary of Transportation. He previously served as the 48th Governor of New Jersey from 1982 to 1990. He was first elected over his opponent in 1981 by just a margin of 1,797 votes. However, by the time he was up for re-election in 1985, he had proven his worth and was re-elected with 69.6% of the vote, the largest ever in New Jersey's history. He delivered the keynote speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention as well. President Dole nominated him to be the Transportation Secretary due to his experience managing the vast transportation networks of New Jersey, a large commuter state. He is not controversial, so his confirmation went off without a hitch.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144804762.png" alt="Secretary Wallop" />
                <p><strong>Malcolm Wallop,</strong> a former United States Senator from Wyoming, is the 8th United States Secretary of Energy. An old colleague of the President's, he was selected for his role due to his extensive work in the energy field of legislation, being a key proponent behind the Energy Policy Act of 1992, also serving as the Ranking Member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Therefore, his credentials were well established, and he was confirmed without much issue.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144821485.png" alt="Secretary Sullivan" />
                <p><strong>Dr. Louis Wade Sullivan</strong> is a throwback to the Bush Administration. He was previously the 17th HSS Secretary. On the other hand, time around though, President Dole decided to take a different direction with Sullivan. He nominated him to be the 7th United States Secretary of Education due to his strong educational and medical credentials. Due to his previous service in the Bush Administration, he was confirmed once again without a hitch.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144839355.png" alt="Secretary Rumsfeld" />
                <p><strong>Donald Henry Rumsfeld</strong> is yet another throwback from previous administrations, this time the Nixon and Ford Administrations, in various capacities, such as Counselor to the President, Chief of Staff, UN Ambassador, and Defense Secretary. He was offered the latter job by Dole, given his efforts in the election, being the national chair of the Dole/Kemp '96 campaign, however Rumsfeld after debating the possibility decided he'd want to take a more low key position for the moment. So, Dole obliged, and nominated him to be the 3rd United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, which he was confirmed to. Dole also indicated if the Defense Secretary spot opens up again, he'll be his first choice.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144926147.png" alt="Administrator Rehberg" />
                <p><strong>Dennis Ray Rehberg</strong> was the GOP's nominee for the Senate race in Montana in 1996. Despite Dole's victory in the state, he lost the race to incumbent Max Baucus, losing by only 2.7 points, the closest race of Baucus' career. Asides from that, he was Lieutenant Governor of Montana. Dole decided to nominate him to be the 9th Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, given his familiarity with overseeing the vast enviornment of Montana. The Senate took up his nomination, and after scrutiny of not so storied career, he was confirmed.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_144943319.png" alt="Director Rudman" />
                <p><strong>Warren Bruce Rudman</strong>, a former US Senator, was nominated to be the 18th Director of Central Intelligence due to his strong intelligence credentials, and his previous work in this area being bipartisan, being able to use that to demonstrate the political independence of the CIA. Due to his popularity with his former colleagues, along with his credentials, he was easily confirmed.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_145016120.png" alt="Trade Representative Chao" />
                <p><strong>Elaine Lan Chao</strong> is the former Director of the Peace Corps, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Chair of the Federal Maritime Commission, and most importantly, the wife to rising figure Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, currently the Republican Campaign Committee Chairman. She was nominated to be the 13th United States Trade Representative, and was easily confirmed to the post due to her past experience and her relationship with their colleague, being sworn in by her husband.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_145040644.png" alt="Ambassador Bolton" />
                <p><strong>John Robert Bolton</strong> is a noted expert on foreign policy in the Republican Party. Working for the State Department, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Bush and Reagan Administrations, he opposed financial reparations to Japanese-Americans, as well as sheparding Antonin Scalia's nomination through the Senate. He was also involved in the Iran-Contra Crisis, and helped expand the war on drugs. Because of these facts, his confirmation to be the 21st United States Ambassador to the United Nations was a partisan vote. His association with Senator Jesse Helms is a possible olive branch to the orthodox wing of the party.</p>
				
				<img src="https://file.garden/aBFeR_WWax4tG4dU/image_2025-09-20_145059951.png" alt="Chief Reed" />
                <p><strong>Scott Reed</strong> is the man who organized Dole's campaign, leading up to it's suprise victory. He worked hard for the ticket, so Dole decided to reward him by making him his chief advisor, the Chief of Staff. He is considered very loyal to President Dole, and also enjoys a good relationship with Vice President Kemp, as he worked on his 1988 campaign, so oftentimes Reed is the one who coordinates efforts between the two due to their testy relationship.</p>
